Senf, F., A. Voigt, N. Clerbaux, A. HÃ¼nerbein, and H. Deneke, **Does increasing resolution and resolving convection improve simulated cloud-radiative effects over the North Atlantic?**, J. Geophys. Res. Atmos., submitted in Jan. 2020


An **overview** is provided [here](nbooks/00-Overview.ipynb) as starting point. All figures from the main manuscript is listed and links to the corresponding notebooks are given. 


## Python Package for Plotting and Analysis 

A python package was developed to support the analysis for the mentioned paper. The package is found [https://gitea.tropos.de/senf/proj.nawdex_analysis](https://gitea.tropos.de/senf/proj.nawdex_analysis).


## Dependencies
Some Notebooks depend on my work tools from the `tropy` package which are collected here [https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy](https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy)
